  <em>Our approach to ML automation and the general problem</em>
</p>

Applying Linux kernel development methodologies to machine learning research for rapid iteration and reproducible experimentation. Kconfig-driven configuration, defconfig presets, Makefile automation, and rigorous test matrices enable fast prototyping of transformer architectures, pruning algorithms, and optimization techniques while maintaining reproducibility and collaboration at scale.

> **⚡ Adam State-Based Pruning**: bitter7 achieves **15.6% better perplexity** than magnitude baseline (37.28 vs 44.15 PPL), validating the hypothesis that Adam's gradient statistics enable superior pruning decisions. Tested on NVIDIA B200 GPUs with torch.compile.

## Development Philosophy

knlp applies **Linux kernel development practices** to machine learning research:

- **Kconfig-based configuration**: Hierarchical menus for experiment management (like `make menuconfig`)
- **Defconfig presets**: Reproducible configurations for different hardware and research goals
- **Makefile-driven builds**: Consistent build and test workflows across models
- **Documented decisions**: Every architectural choice explained in `docs/`
- **Collaborative contributions**: Community-driven ideas and ablation studies
- **Rigorous validation**: Automated test matrices before merging experiments

This methodology enables rapid iteration on transformer architectures and state-based optimization while maintaining reproducibility and rigor.

## Key Results

### Adam State based Pruning R&D results

| Model | Parameters | Dataset | Sparsity | Accuracy/Perplexity | Notes |
|-------|------------|---------|----------|---------------------|-------|
| GPT-2 | 124M | FineWebEdu | 50% | **37.28 PPL** | **bitter7 (15.6% better)** |
| ResNet-50 | 25.6M | CIFAR-100 | 50% | 74.56% | bitter0 (original hybrid) |
| ResNet-18 | 11.2M | CIFAR-10 | 70% | 90.66% | bitter0 (original hybrid) |
| LeNet-5 | 61.7K | MNIST | 70% | 98.9% | bitter0 (original hybrid) |

bitter0 (original hybrid momentum-stability) achieved excellent results
on CNNs. bitter7 (variance-based) emerged from transformer R&D and is
expected to improve CNN results further. See evolution story below.

### Adam State-Based Pruning: Hypothesis Validated

Our Adam state-based pruning research conclusively validates the
hypothesis that **leveraging Adam's accumulated gradient statistics
enables superior pruning decisions** compared to magnitude-based
approaches. State-based variants (bitter7, bitter8) significantly
outperform magnitude pruning baseline when tested with identical
hyperparameters on NVIDIA B200 GPUs.

![AdamWPrune Comparison](images/adamwprune_fair_comparison.png)
*State-based pruning outperforms magnitude baseline with identical
hyperparameters. All runs WITH torch.compile on B200: bitter8
achieves 40.94 PPL (7.3% better), bitter7 achieves 37.28 PPL
(15.6% better) than movement pruning baseline (44.15 PPL).*

**Test Configuration:**
- Model: GPT-2 (124M parameters)
- Dataset: FineWebEdu
- Target Sparsity: 50%
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0006, Weight Decay: 0.1
- **Hyperparameters:** AUTO mode (adapts to available hardware)

See [docs/pruning.md](docs/pruning.md) for complete pruning research details,
hyperparameter auto-detection, ResNet results, and transformer findings.

## Research Areas

knlp serves as a collaborative platform for ML architecture research:

- **[AdamWPrune](docs/pruning.md)**: State-based pruning leveraging Adam optimizer state variables for zero-overhead pruning decisions during training
- **[Weight Tying](docs/weight-tying.md)**: Parameter reduction through strategic sharing
- **[KV Tying](docs/kv-tying.md)**: Attention projection parameter reduction
- **[Mechanistic Interpretability](docs/mechint.md)**: Post-training circuit analysis

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details on the kernel-inspired infrastructure.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

For systems using `torch.compile()`, Python development headers are required:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-dev

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install python3-devel
```

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
wandb login # optional
```

### Run Your First Experiment

```bash
make defconfig-gpt2-vanilla-baseline
make
```

That's it! The experiment will run and save results automatically.

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for detailed workflow and
advanced options. See [docs/tracker.md](docs/tracker.md) for experiment
tracking with WandB or Trackio.
